# ToC-saws

## ALERT(LOOKING FOR CONTRIBUTOR)
- **Qualification**: should possess a copy of Ullman's book(Indian edition) and should be willing to contribute.

## About the repo
- I think it's safe to say most of us are facing problems in finding problems(lmao) from Ullman and Sipser's books due to the lack of indian edition softcopies online.
- To resolve this, i present to you ToC-saws which should contain all the p-sets posted on the gc by our instructor.
- I have a tendency to forget about posting stuff. So don't hesitate to remind me if you find some p-set(s) is(are) missing from the repo.
- Enjoy! :)
