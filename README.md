# ToC-saws

## ALERT(LOOKING FOR CONTRIBUTOR)
- **Qualification**: should possess a copy of Ullman's book(Indian edition) and should be willing to contribute.

## About the repo(with a side of important instructions)
- I think it's safe to say most of us are facing problems in finding problems(lmao) from Ullman and Sipser's books due to the lack of indian edition softcopies online.
- To resolve this, i present to you ToC-saws which should contain all the p-sets posted on the gc by our instructor.
- The problems which are to be attempted(as prescribed by sir) are encircled so there shouldn't be a problem regarding what and what not to attempt.
- However, if you face any problem(s)(more specifically, regarding the visibility of the problem) then feel free to raise an issue.
- **Nomenclature:** files are labelled in the form "n-set.pdf". Here n denotes the nth p-set posted by sir.
- I have a tendency to forget about posting stuff. So don't hesitate to remind me if you find some p-set(s) is(are) missing from the repo. Simply raise an issue or dm me if you know who i am.
- Enjoy! :)
